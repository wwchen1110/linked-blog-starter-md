Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights rise to the occasion for key battles, holding the line with their [[Discipline]] using flashes of [[Ardor]] at key moments to secure the victory. By mixing stamina-efficient skills with powerful burst as needed, Knights consistently outmatch their opponents to build up unbeatable advantages.

UNIQUE:
Challenger (P): Every 2 turns you outcombat the last targeted enemy, gain ATK/DEF until you rest
Coat of Arms: Target an enemy, and upgrade an ACT slot with "Buff max HP/STA when you slot a combat skill here. Didn't outcombat target (last 3 turns): downgrade"
Joust: Attack and block. Outcombat (next 3 turns): attack and block again

DISCIPLINE:
Bulwark: Block and taunt
Charge: Attack scaling with STA
Truestrike: Attack. Low CD, low STA cost
Vanquish: Attack, evening up combat from last turn

ARDOR:
Dominate: If you outcombatted the enemy this turn, gain ATK/DEF for 2 turns
Clash: Attack an enemy, and you are now taunted to each other until a turn you stop attacking. The enemy can also outcombat you by turn end to break this effect
Adrenaline Rush: Activate only when under half health. Buff ATK moderately for 3 turns
