Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Paradoxically passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights rise to the occasion for key battles, holding the line with their [[Discipline]] using flashes of [[Ardor]] at key moments to secure the victory. By mixing stamina-efficient skills with high-cost skills, Knights consistently out-combat their opponents to build up unbeatable advantages.

UNIQUE:
Challenger: Each turn you combat an enemy, gain ATK/DEF until you rest
Coat of Arms: An ally gains DEF/STA for the next 5 turns, then ATK/CD reduction for the 5 turns after
Joust: Upgrade an ACT slot with “Reduce CD of combat skills here. Downgrade if a combat skill was not slotted here this turn”

DISCIPLINE:
Retribution: While channeled, increase next DMG when you’re attacked/targeted
Charge: Attack scaling with STA
Solid Hit: Attack. Low CD, low STA cost
Rally: Restore STA, refresh a CD

ARDOR:
Heartpiercer: Attack. Double its unblocked damage
Clash: Attack an enemy, and you are now grappling each other until a turn you don’t attack that enemy. The enemy can also outcombat you to break the grapple
Burn Bright: Increase your ATK/DEF for this and the next 3 turns. Each skill you use during this time has its CD doubled
