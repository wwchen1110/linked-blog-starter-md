Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights thrive in the line of fire, staying standing with their [[Discipline]] while dishing out damage with [[Ardor]]. This class is most effective playing on the edge of stamina and health, specializing in keeping themselves just before the brink.

Valiant (P): While STA half or less, gain ATK. While HP is half or less, gain DEF
Coat of Arms: If under half STA, gain moderate ATK. If under half HP, next attack gains lifesteal
Joust: Attack and block. Restore STA/HP equal to the damage/block.

DISCIPLINE:
