Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights thrive in the line of fire, staying standing with their [[Discipline]] while dishing out damage with [[Ardor]]. This class is most effective playing on the edge of stamina and health, specializing in keeping themselves just before the brink.
