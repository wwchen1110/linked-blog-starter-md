Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights rise to the occasion for key battles, holding the line with their [[Discipline]] using flashes of [[Ardor]] at key moments to secure the victory. By mixing stamina-efficient skills with powerful burst as needed, Knights consistently out-combat their opponents to build up unbeatable advantages.

UNIQUE:
Challenger (P): Each turn you combat an enemy, gain ATK/DEF until you rest
Coat of Arms: Target an enemy, and upgrade an ACT slot with "Restore HP/STA when you slot a combat skill here. Didn't outcombat target (last 2 turns): downgrade"
Joust: Attack and block. Outcombat (next 3 turns): attack and block again

DISCIPLINE:
Shield Slam: Block and taunt
Charge: Attack scaling with STA
Truestrike: Attack. Low CD, low STA cost
Hammer: Attack. Upgrade this slot with "Gain ATK/DEF here until you don't slot a combat skill here"

ARDOR:
Reckless Swing: Big attack. Take some damage
Clash: Attack an enemy, and you are now taunted to each other until a turn you stop attacking. The enemy can also outcombat you to break this effect
Burn Bright: Gain ATK/DEF for this and the next 3 turns. Each skill you use during this time has its CD doubled
