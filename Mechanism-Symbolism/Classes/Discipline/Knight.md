Ego serving Persona - the Hero who fights for a cause. Paradoxically passionate yet restrained, willful yet obedient.

The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the hour of fate is clear to see, few classes are better equipped to win the day than the Knight.

Knights rise to the occasion for key battles, holding the line with their [[Discipline]] using flashes of [[Ardor]] at key moments to secure the victory. By mixing stamina-efficient skills with high-cost skills, Knights consistently out-combat their opponents to build up unbeatable advantages.

UNIQUE:
Challenger (P): Each turn you combat an enemy, gain ATK/DEF until you rest
Coat of Arms: Upgrade an ACT slot with "Restore HP/STA when you slot a combat skill here. Downgrade if you didn't outcombat the enemy this turn"
Joust: Attack and block. Deal more for each time you've outcombatted an enemy this game

DISCIPLINE:
Shield Drum: Next turn, taunt and block
Charge: Attack scaling with STA
Solid Hit: Attack. Low CD, low STA cost
Rally: Restore STA, refresh a CD

ARDOR:
Reckless Swing: Big attack. Take some damage
Clash: Attack an enemy, and you are now taunted to each other until a turn you stop attacking. The enemy can also outcombat you to break this effect
