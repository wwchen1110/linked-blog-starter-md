Judge - morality policing. Unlike the Mastermind, the Inquisitor believes their control to be just.

Discipline classes tend to be susceptible to attacks from other angles, but this is where the Inquisitor steps in to root out trickery. Armed with a cool head and honed training, this class excels at combining debuffs and defenses to corner and quash an opponent's assault.

An Inquisitor's bread and butter revolves around exposing an enemy's strategy with their high [[Cunning]], and blunting its effectiveness with their high [[Discipline]]. As opposed to an Assassin, who respond perfectly to a single move, Inquisitors gradually defang their opponent.

UNIQUE:
Interrogator (P): Each turn you combat with an enemy, declare an action type or a skill name. The enemy chooses a skill of that type or name to expose from their skillset
Shackle: Lock any number of your skills to lock the same number of enemies' exposed skills. You can unlock them all as a free action
Trial: Target an enemy and declare an action type/combat stat (T3: enemy uses ACT type). An ally restores HP/STA, and the enemy's combat stat is reduced permanently

DISCIPLINE:
Shield Drum: Next turn, taunt and block
Stonewall: Block and reduce attacker STA
Disarm: Attack. Expose and lock targeted enemy's last skill for 2 turns
Composure: Can activate if and only if locked. Gain HP/STA, buff DEF

CUNNING:
[[Cunning#Profile|Profile]]: Expose all skills of one action type in enemy skillset

[[Cunning#Coerce|Coerce]]: Target an enemy and declare an action type and an ACT slot. If that slot doesn't have that type next turn, they lose HP/STA
