Judge - morality policing. Unlike the Mastermind, the Inquisitor believes their control to be just.

Discipline classes tend to be susceptible to attacks from other angles, but this is where the Inquisitor steps in to root out trickery. Armed with a cool head and grim determination, this class excels at combining debuffs and defenses to corner and quash an opponent's assault.

An Inquisitor's bread and butter revolves around exposing an enemy's strategy with their high [[Cunning]], and blunting its effectiveness with their high [[Discipline]]. As opposed to an Assassin, who can respond perfectly to a single move, Inquisitors gradually defang their opponent.

UNIQUE:
Interrogator: Each turn you target an enemy or are targeted by an enemy, declare an action type or a skill name. The enemy chooses a skill of that type or name to expose from their skillset
Accusation: Target an enemy. Lock any number of their exposed skills until you rest, paying increasing STA cost for each lock
Trial: Target an enemy and choose an action type/combat stat secretly (T3: enemy uses action type. An ally restores HP/STA, and the stat is reduced permanently)

DISCIPLINE:
Taunt: Target an enemy; next turn they must attempt to attack you
Riposte (stance): No attacks or defenses, halve SPD. Counter all attacks
Ward: Block or gain Spellshield
Composure: Activate while CC'd. Gain STA

CUNNING:
Profile: Expose all skills of one action type in enemy skillset
Expose (T: enemy targets you with a covered skill): Expose and lock that skill for 5 turns
Coerce: Target an enemy and declare an action type and an ACT slot. If that slot doesn't have that type next turn, they lose HP/STA
