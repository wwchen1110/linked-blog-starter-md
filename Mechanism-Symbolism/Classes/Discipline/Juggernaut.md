The Sentinel - the Guardian of Guardians. The Juggernaut in particular represents a Senex-influenced Sentinel, the guard of the known world who maintains the boundaries.

Juggernauts are the single class with the highest [[Discipline]] in the game. This means they are capable of things no other class is. No class can match the unconditional healing of Acclimate. A juggernaut's Quake not only taunts like other discipline classes, but also turns nearby terrain difficult and slows enemies. And while Crush may have a longer windup than any other melee skill, it also deals massive damage.

UNIQUE:
Titan (P): Increase your HP, max STA, ATK, and DEF. Lose an ACT slot
Quake: Massive AoE attack, taking 1 turn. Enemy ACT slots downgrade with "Non-combat skills cost 5 more STA here. Downgrade when you slot a combat skill here"
Turtle (stance): Your slots cannot downgrade

SYNERGIES:
Acclimate: Upgrade a slot with "Heal/block more here. Downgrade when you slot a non-combat skill here"
Iron Fist: When you use the same slot for the same type last turn, upgrade the slot with "lower STA costs" until you stop
Steel Yourself: Gain DEF until you rest
Mirror Shield: Block. This turn, enemies take damage you block
Entrench: Block. Next turn, block
