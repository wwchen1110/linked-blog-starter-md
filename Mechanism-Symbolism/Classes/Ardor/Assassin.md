High [[Ardor]] and high [[Cunning]] allows this class to find or create the perfect time to strike hard. Using debuffs and traps while biding time, an Assassin guarantees that their blade will strike the mark.

Blackout (T: enemy uses declared skill name): Gain Stealth 3, gain DMG to your next attack
Hidden Blade: Declare a skill name. If your next attack matches that name, deal significantly increased damage

ARDOR:
Preemptive Strike: Attack. Negate matching enemy attack if faster
Heartpiercer: Attack. Double its unblocked damage
Shredder: Attack. Deal double damage to block
Whet: Your next combat skill is moderately stronger

CUNNING:
Goad: Increase a unit's ATK but reduce its DEF
Sneak Attack: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
Glimpse: Target an enemy. Reveal their first ACT slot next turn
