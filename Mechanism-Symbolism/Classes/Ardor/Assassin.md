High [[Ardor]] and high [[Cunning]] allows this class to find or create the perfect time to strike hard. Using debuffs and traps while biding time, an Assassin guarantees that their blade will strike the mark.

UNIQUE:
Sting: Attack. If this deals unblocked damage, reveal the enemy's first action in two turns
Blackout: Your next 3 attacks are Stealthed
Hidden Blade: Declare a skill name. If your next attack matches that name, deal significantly increased damage

ARDOR:
Pounce (T3: target enemy has 0 block): Attack
Heartpiercer: Attack. Double its unblocked damage
Shatter: Attack. Block only reduces half its damage (rounded up)
Crossup: Attack. If uncontested, slot 1 more skill in this slot next round

CUNNING:
[[Cunning#Goad/Daunt|Goad/Daunt]]: Redistribute some of a unit's ATK/DEF
[[Cunning#Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
[[Cunning#Glimpse|Glimpse]]: Target an enemy. They must reveal an action and its slot next turn
