The Champion - 

It's not rare for an adventurer to have a thirst for blood, nor is it rare that one has a steely obsession. Indeed, it's the mix of the two in the Gladiator that makes them such a foe to be reckoned with, wielding both efficiency and brutality as if they were two parts of a single weapon.

A Gladiator utilizes their high [[Ardor|Ardor]] and [[Discipline]] to confront and overpower opponents, and they're rewarded with refreshed stamina. While a Knight looks for a prolonged battle to prove their worth, Gladiators just look ahead to the next trade. Their powerful abilities have large stamina costs, but winning their combats gives Gladiators the energy to keep up the pressure.
