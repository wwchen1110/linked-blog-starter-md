The Strategist

A winning smile, a charming personality, and a lust for power writhing under the skin. Don't be fooled by the Noble's name - Discipline is merely an aesthetic they use to better leverage their Cunning. They'll punish a step out of line with the life-ending consequences.

The Noble is the inverse of the Inquisitor. Where the Inquisitor builds a comprehensive profile to efficiently contain an enemy, the Noble builds a profile the enemy is incentivized to contain themselves within. Obedience is safe, as the Noble rewards their subjects with health and stamina. However, every second spent under their rule makes them stronger. Disobey them to avoid giving them power, but starve as you're denied their infrastructure.

UNIQUE:
[[Cunning#Verdict|Verdict]] (T6: target enemy's declared action type not in declared slot) 
-Pardon: enemy gains STA, treat the action as the declared ACT type
-Punish: enemy loses STA, takes damage scaling with your buffs to other units
[[Cunning#Noblesse Oblige|Noblesse Oblige]] (P): Once per turn when you buff a unit, an enemy declares an ACT type they will use next turn. If you buffed an enemy you choose which ACT type they declare
[[Cunning#Convention|Convention]]: Declare an ACT type/slot. Until you rest, when any unit uses that type in that slot your next buff/debuff is stronger

CUNNING:
[[Cunning#Token Gesture|Token Gesture]]: Select any targets. When this skill is type, name, or trait checked, decide which type, name, and trait it counts as
[[Cunning#Thronebreaker|Thronebreaker]]: Target an enemy. Invert their buffs
[[Cunning#Dissonance|Dissonance]]: (T1: Target enemy uses declared ACT type in declared ACT slot) If this matches that action type, lock all their skills of that type for 3 turns
[[Cunning#Goad|Goad]]: Increase a unit's ATK but reduce its DEF

DISCIPLINE:
Kingmaker: Buff a unit's ATK/DEF. Scales with the number of times you've buffed a unit this game
Phalanx: Select an ACT slot. All allies upgrade that slot with "If you block here, buff your DEF. Downgrade when you rest"
Demesne: Select an ACT slot/type. Upgrade that slot for everyone with "If you play that ACT type here, buff DEF. Downgrade if you slot anything else here."
