The Strategist

A winning smile, a charming personality, and a lust for power writhing under the skin. Don't be fooled by the Noble's name - Discipline is merely an aesthetic they use to better leverage their Cunning. They'll punish a step out of line with the life-ending consequences.

The Noble is the inverse of the Inquisitor. Where the Inquisitor builds a comprehensive profile to efficiently contain an enemy, the Noble builds a profile the enemy is incentivized to contain themselves within. Obedience is safe, as the Noble rewards their subjects with health and stamina. However, every second spent under their rule makes them stronger. Disobey them to avoid giving them power, but starve as you're denied their infrastructure.

UNIQUE:
Pardon or Punish (T1: declared action type not in slot of interest) 
-Pardon: enemy gains STA, treat the action as the declared action type
-Punish: enemy loses STA, takes damage scaling with your buffs to other units
Noblesse Oblige: Once per turn, gain ATK/DEF when you buff. Gain extra if it's an enemy
Demesne: Select an ACT slot/type. Upgrade that slot for everyone with "If you play that action type here, buff HP/STA. Downgrade if you slot anything else here."

CUNNING:
Token Gesture: Select any targets. When this skill is type, name, or trait checked, decide which type, name, and trait it counts as
Thronebreaker: Target an enemy. Invert their buffs
Dissonance: Target an enemy and declare an action type. If this matches that action type, lock all their skills of that type for 3 turns
Convention: Declare an action type and an action slot. For the next 5 turns, whenever any unit uses that slot for that action, strengthen your next buff/debuff

DISCIPLINE:
Kingmaker: Buff a unit's ATK/DEF. Scales with the number of times you've buffed a unit this game
Iron Fist: When you use the same slot for the same type last turn, upgrade the slot with "lower STA costs" until you stop
