The Provocateur

Warlords increase their range of possible actions, making their bursts harder to predict and mitigate. They can then follow this up with conditionally powerful attacks

UNIQUE:
[[Cunning#Drums of War|Drums of War]]: Declare secretly whether you will skip the next turn. If you do, gain 5 ACT the turn after
[[Cunning#Ride at Night|Ride at Dusk]] (P): Each time you rest, Stealth your next 3 skills
[[Cunning#Coup d'Etat|Coup d'Etat]]: Attack. If uncontested and the enemy is low enough, kill them. High CD, high STA cost

CUNNING:
[[Cunning#Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
[[Cunning#Outmaneuver|Outmaneuver]]: The enemy declares an ACT type and you set a trap (T2: you don't use enemy's secretly declared ACT type) Gain Stealth 2
[[Cunning#Insinuation|Insinuation]]: Target an enemy. If uncontested, reduce enemy ATK/DEF and they lose HP/STA for 3 turns
[[Cunning#Underhand|Underhand]]: Gain Stealth until you resolve your next 2 skills

ARDOR:
Crossup: Attack. If uncontested, you can slot 1 more skill here next round
Finisher: Attack. Deal more for each attack this turn
