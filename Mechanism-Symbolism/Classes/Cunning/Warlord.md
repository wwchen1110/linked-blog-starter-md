The Provocateur

When facing a Warlord, you can either concede or resist. Concession gives the Warlord free rein, but limits their maximum control. Resistance fuels their fire, letting them extend the reach of their tyranny, but gives you a fighting chance.

UNIQUE:
Ultimatum: Declare an ACT type. If the enemy uses that type next turn, you have double the ACT slots
Conqueror: For each extra ACT slot you gain, you can add another ACT type to your next declaration
Tyranny: Declare an ACT type. For the next 3 turns, when an enemy uses that type, reduce your lowest CD and gain a temporary ACT slot

CUNNING:
Gauntlet: Target an enemy and declare an ACT type. If they don't match it in 3 actions, lock all skills of that type from them for 2 turns
Sneak Attack: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
Ambush (T6: enemy doesn't use declared ACT type): Attack, dealing big damage
Capitulate: An enemy declares an ACT type. For the next 3 turns they cannot use skills of that type

ARDOR:
