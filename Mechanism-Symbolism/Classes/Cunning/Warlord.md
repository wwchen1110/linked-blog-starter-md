The Provocateur

Warlords increase their range of possible actions, making their bursts harder to predict and mitigate. They can then follow this up with conditionally powerful attacks

UNIQUE:
[[Cunning#Pincer Maneuver|Pincer Maneuver]]: Declare secretly whether you will skip the next turn. If you do, gain 5 ACT slots the turn afterwards
[[Cunning#Ride at Night|Ride at Dusk]] (P): Every 2 empty ACT slots you commit, gain 1 ACT slot next turn
[[Cunning#Coup d'Etat|Coup d'Etat]]: Attack. If uncontested and the enemy is low enough, kill them. High CD, high STA cost

CUNNING:
[[Cunning#Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]]: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
[[Cunning#Outmaneuver|Outmaneuver]] (T2: you don't use enemy's secretly declared ACT type): Gain Stealth 2
[[Cunning#Insinuation|Insinuation]]: Target an enemy. If uncontested, reduce enemy ATK/DEF and they lose HP/STA for 3 turns
[[Cunning#Underhand|Underhand]]: Gain Stealth until you resolve your next 2 skills

ARDOR:
Overwhelm: Attack. If unblocked, debuff DEF. If uncontested, reduce ATK and STA
Finisher: Attack. Deal more for each attack this turn
Scorched Earth: For the next 3 turns, all units gain an extra ACT slot
