The classic magician, many other casters tend to be mistaken for the Wizard. This is no surprise; to those uninitiated to the arcane, a Wizard represents all the mysterious power of a spellcaster turned up to full force. 

A well of pure [[Vision]], wizards are distinguished from their other caster siblings with their massive mana pool. Rather than relying on other gameplay patterns to satisfy their spellcasting requirements, wizards must simply continue casting big spells.
