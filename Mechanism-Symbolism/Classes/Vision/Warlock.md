When an ambitious mortal signs a pact with the higher powers, a warlock is born. Unlike the wizard, who simply exists as a conduit of magic, the warlock connives their way into power for their own ends.

With both [[Vision]] and [[Cunning]], Warlock spells are best cast from the shadows. Between mind control, necromancy, and plagues, these tools give Warlocks the ability to tighten their grasp of the battlefield. Mirroring the Enchanter, a Warlock prefers a more direct approach over subtle mind games, seizing control of their enemy if need be. A Warlockâ€™s spells range from Minor Possession, Reanimate, and Toxic Cloud to Mind Control, Gates of Hell and Dark Infestation. Contrasting the Wizard, whose spells require large amounts of sparks to be channeled, Warlock spells tend to require very specific conditions to be cast. In exchange, their spells are light on spark costs, meaning Warlocks will usually not be bottlenecked by sparks. Under the specific conditions a Warlock has formed their contract for, they are the rulers of the realm.
