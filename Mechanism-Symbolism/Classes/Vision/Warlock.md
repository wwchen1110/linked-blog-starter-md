The Alchemist

When an ambitious mortal signs a pact with the higher powers, a warlock is born. Unlike the wizard, who simply exists as a conduit of magic, the warlock connives their way into power for their own ends.

With both [[Vision]] and [[Cunning]], Warlock spells are best cast from the shadows. Between mind control, necromancy, and plagues, these tools give Warlocks the ability to tighten their grasp of the battlefield. Mirroring the Enchanter, a Warlock prefers a more direct approach over subtle mind games, seizing control of their enemy if need be. A Warlockâ€™s spells range from Minor Possession, Reanimate, and Toxic Cloud to Mind Control, Gates of Hell and Dark Infestation. Contrasting the Wizard, whose spells require large amounts of sparks to be channeled, Warlock spells tend to require very specific conditions to be cast. In exchange, their spells are light on spark costs, meaning Warlocks will usually not be bottlenecked by sparks. Under the specific conditions a Warlock has formed their contract for, they are the rulers of the realm.

UNIQUE:
Pactbound (P): Each turn, target an enemy and secretly declare an ACT type. If they took that ACT type, your next spell releases 1 less

VISION:
Primordia - Sceptrum: Inscription length 6. Imbue 1, 1 CD
Death (ES): The ultimate boundary that nothing flows past. Permanent decay, necromancy, chthonic underworld abilities, anti healing
Chaos (FS): Flaws in enduring truths that can result in destructive collapse. Madness, disintegration, bond breaking
Heresy (LS): The acknowledgment and subsequent subversion of truth, or the acknowledgment and subsequent veneration of fantasy. Hijacking higher truth, reversing relationships with higher powers, turning illusions into reality

CUNNING:
Paralysis: Target an enemy. If they have 6+ debuffs, they must reveal 2 actions next turn
Dissonance: Target an enemy and declare an action type. If this matches that action type, lock all their skills of that type for 3 turns
Gauntlet: Target an enemy and declare an ACT type. If they don't match it in 3 actions, lock all skills of that type from them for 2 turns
