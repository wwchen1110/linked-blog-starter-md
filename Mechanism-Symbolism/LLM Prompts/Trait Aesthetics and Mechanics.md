Discipline and Ardor are mirror traits. Cunning and Vision are mirror traits. When comparing these traits, or concepts composed from these traits, they will act as foils to each other. From the perspective of an Ardent character, for example, high Discipline can be interpreted as a weakness. Similarly, a Cunning character may interpret high Vision as a weakness. Any "purist" character that only prioritizes a single trait may interpret high Balance as a weakness.
