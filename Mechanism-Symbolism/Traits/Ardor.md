"Take the shot or lose the chance."

This trait represents the willingness to seize fleeting opportunities, discarding inhibitions and living in the moment. Ardent individuals take impossible leaps without hesitation, and somehow land on the other side.

Ardor is the primary trait of [[Gladiator|Gladiators]], [[Assassin|Assassins]], [[Spellblade|Spellblades]], and [[Swashbuckler|Swashbucklers]], as well as the specialized trait of [[Berserker|Berserkers]]. It is also the secondary trait of [[Knight|Knights]], [[Warlord|Warlords]], [[Sorcerer|Sorcerers]], and [[Hunter|Hunters]]. These classes are characterized by their ability to close out fights, commit on opportunities, and build volatile advantages.
