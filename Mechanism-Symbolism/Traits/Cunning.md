"Know when the mask confines and when it frees."

This trait represents a focus on social roles, using personas to predict and control behavior. Cunning individuals have their hand on the scale to before a sword is swung.

Cunning is the primary trait of [[Noble|Nobles]], [[Warlord|Warlords]], Enchanters, and Rogues, as well as the specialized trait of Masterminds. It is also the secondary trait of [[Inquisitor|Inquisitors]], [[Assassin|Assassins]], [[Warlock|Warlocks]], and [[Bard|Bards]]. These classes are characterized by their ability to gather information, limit their opponent's options, and efficiently counterplay.

For each point in Cunning, gain a tier of [[Passive Perception]]
