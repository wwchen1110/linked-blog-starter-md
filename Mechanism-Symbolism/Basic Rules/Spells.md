On character creation:
	- assign {Vision} x 2 elements to the 6 resonances
Before combat:
	- arrange your elements in any order on any skills
	- this creates inscriptions (element patterns) on skills
At the end of each turn:
	- imbue 1 inscription's next element
	- you can only imbue like this {Vision} x 5 times per battle
At each rest:
	- move up to {Vision} inscribed elements to other inscriptions

Inscriptions:
Skills can only hold inscriptions of length 1 unless otherwise specified. A skill can only hold imbued elements up to its inscription length. If you've imbued an inscription's last element, its next imbue will be its first element

Spellcasting:
Using any skill with an inscription opens up a simultaneous action to cast spells. Casting a spell puts that spell on CD for the user. It also unleashes the imbued elements that were in the casting requirements. 

Spells:
Spells cost a combination of 1 to 5 elements to cast. Low cost spells have generic utility, but are weak; high cost spells are proportionally more powerful, but in a specific direction. Low cost spells are named in Latin, representing basic facets of the universe that any school of magic can agree on. High cost spells split off in naming schemes based on their dominant element, representing sophisticated interpretations of the universe.

A single long inscription gives characters stacking flexibility, allowing them access to high-level spells and picking from any combination of imbued elements. An array of short inscriptions spread across many skills gives characters immediate flexibility, letting them pick which inscription's next element they want to imbue.
