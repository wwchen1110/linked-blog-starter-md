All traits are magic, but spellcasting involves an active shaping of magic
Vision is the trait that allows for active magic shaping, as opposed to just 'being magical'
Shaping of magic takes time, much like creating anything new
Spells can also have higher impact than any other skill
Spellcasting power should have to ramp up
If your innate magic matches the spell's magic, minor benefit? Major benefit?

Spells vs skills: spellcasters should have wider repertoire than martial classes. Multiple spells per skill? Shared cooldown maybe
Spells should not have the flexibility of Balance skills. Larger range of possibilities but less control? Have to cast spell corresponding to current spark count? Specific action type triggers spell swap?
3 spells in a skill is a good amount for complexity? Should these be similar spells but different power, or different spells at same power?
Imbue skills to use Vision passively, or just treat them like spell slots in DnD? Should known spells scale exponentially with Vision, or should it scale linearly?
Should give make things slower, more impactful in an esoteric way? Make spells into higher level versions, make skills higher stats but delayed?
