Discipline and Ardor are mirror traits. Cunning and Vision are mirror traits. When comparing these traits, or concepts composed from these traits, they will act as foils to each other.

For each of my 5 traits, define the strongest argument that this concept is a poor fit for that trait's aesthetics, using specific evidence. Store it as X.

Next, create a counterargument to X using a subset of the trait's aesthetics as evidence. Score the counterargument from 1 to 5, based on how well it fits with the trait aesthetics.

Score how foundational the full concept is to the trait. A score of 1 means that there are distinct concepts that could take the place of this concept in constructing the trait, and a score of 5 means that this concept is necessary to have this trait.
