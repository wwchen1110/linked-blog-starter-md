We could have an element for each trait, then an element for each pair of traits for completion's sake. 15 elemental domains of spells might be a bit to develop and track though, so maybe it works best as a theorycrafting mechanism, to keep each class's trait overlaps in sight. Spellcasting uses Vision; let's center elements around Vision and think of the most classic archetypal elements to include.

Fire - duh. I've explored variations where this represents Ardor and Ardor/Balance, though there is a hint of Vision in it as well. High damage, temporary ascension, we sometimes play around with its indiscriminate nature as well. If we wanted to get crazy, we could fold Light into this or this into Light
Order - makes a lot of sense for Paladins and Clerics, pretty cleanly Discipline/Vision. Gradual ascension, humility, obedience to a higher power. We could fold this into Light
Light - the most Vision element. Escalate the ceiling of power
Shadow - the most Cunning element, but it must be implemented with Vision somewhat in mind. Stealth, complete control, complete omniscience, super effective against the vulnerable
Earth? - flavors of Discipline/Balance. Low-to-the-ground magic that focuses on boosting your mundane actions
Cold? - since we have clean Discipline/Vision, this acts as clean Discipline/Cunning. Methodical control, entropy. We could stand to fold this into Water (which feels more Discipline/Balance, but whatever). We could also fold the mechanics into Shadow
Thunder - the Ardor to Order's Discipline. Impressive power unleashed in a dramatic burst. Could maybe be folded into Fire
Chaos - the counterpoint to Order. Immediate ascension at long-term consequence. Overlaps with Fire's temporary ascension, though there is a cool aesthetic that counters Order's here
Nature/Wood - could maybe be justified. Rotate elemental resonances, combine elements, reward diversity.
Water - changing inscriptions, heal, cleanse. Kinda Balance/Discipline in mechanics, Balance/Vision in aesthetics. Very classic element though
Air - imbuing out of order, fast casting. Thunder is kind of the child of Air and Fire. Mechanics and aesthetics Balance/Cunning. Classic element
Metal - incredibly cool symbol to bridge Discipline and Ardor. Probably not justified as a spellcasting element though
Psychic - incredibly cool symbol to bridge Vision and Cunning. Probably just belongs under Shadow though

Fire - Thunder (mech)/Chaos folded in. Burst imbues, burst unleashes, indiscriminate damage, 1-turn buffs, treating any element as Fire
Earth - Cold/Order mechanics partially folded in. Steady imbues, limit enemy options, channeled buffs to combat actions
Air - Thunder/Nature partially folded in. Instant casting, flexible imbuing, reward precise unleashes 
Water - Cold/Nature partially folded in. Heal, cleanse, reward based on element composition, rotate element resonances, minimize unleashing
Light - Order partially folded in. Reward lots of imbued power, extend inscription length, access the highest power spells
Shadow - Cold/Psychic folded in. Stealth, reveals, complete control, removing ACT slots
