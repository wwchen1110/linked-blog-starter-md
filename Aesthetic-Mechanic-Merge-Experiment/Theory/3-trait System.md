This system works off of the Knight, Rogue, and Wizard as the three axes from which classes can diverge. This is probably the most similar to how DnD does martial classes, where all of them have equal defensive and offensive abilities. The "lawful" classes like Paladins don't translate to grindier fighters, and the "chaotic" classes like Barbarians still have survivability options. "Fighter" is the epitome of this vagueness. DnD also has some significantly thematically divergent classes I'm missing like the Druid, Barbarian, and Sorcerer. In this system you'd probably have to create a Barbarian as a Knight who rages by putting on armor. The Druid could be a Wizard, Warlock, or Bard depending on how much of a spellcaster a Druid is meant to be. The fully-Resonant Druid would probably just be a Wizard that claims their magic comes from nature, while the Resonance-Prowess Druid might take some of their familiarity with nature from lived experience. The Sorcerer's either a spiky Cleric or a colorful Wizard in this system.

I'm keeping the Cleric as a part of the Wizard's axis because magic is a singular, universal thing in a lot of fantasy games. The Paladin fits extremely well as Volition-Resonance, given its ambivalence towards defensive/offensive specialization in a lot of games. I'm thinking through where the Monk and Ranger belong. The Monk seems more like an offshoot of the archetypal Knight than the archetypal Rogue to me, and vice versa for the Ranger.
