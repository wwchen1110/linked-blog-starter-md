Start combat with no spark
Can only cast spells by activating the required sparks
Sparks can only be activated once per turn
Spark decay: At end of turn, if not all sparks activated, lose 1 spark
Spark growth: At end of turn, gain a spark of the type you activated this turn
Lose mana based on number of existing sparks at turn start
At turn start, if mana insufficient to sustain sparks, immediately destroy sparks until mana can sustain
