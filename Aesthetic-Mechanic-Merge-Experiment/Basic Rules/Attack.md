Roll to hit, roll damage? Or assume hit (since armor automatically reduces damage now)
Attacks should do damage (attack > armor)
No opportunity attacks
Discipline for basic attacks? Zeal for special moves? Zeal should be majority of damage, for balance
While special moves available, basic attacks always inferior?
