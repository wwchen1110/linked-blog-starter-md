On character creation:
	- choose up to {Vision} different types of elements to resonate with
Before combat:
	- pick up to {Vision} x 2 elements from the ones they resonate with to imbue onto any skills of their choosing, in any order
	- this creates inscriptions (element patterns) on skills
At the end of each turn:
	- advance 1 inscription (imbue its next element)
	- once an inscription has been advanced to the end, it restarts at the beginning
	- you can only imbue like this {Vision} x 5 times per battle
At each rest:
	- shift up to {Vision} inscribed elements to other elements you resonate with

Spellcasting:
Using any skill with an inscription opens up a simultaneous action to cast a spell. Casting a spell this way puts that spell on CD for the user and spends its STA cost, instead of spending the skill's CD/STA. It also expends the imbued elements that were in the casting requirements. A single long inscription gives characters stacking flexibility, allowing them access to high-level spells and picking from any combination of imbued elements. A series of short inscriptions spread across many skills gives characters immediate flexibility, letting them pick which inscription's next element they want to imbue.
