On character creation:
	- choose up to {Vision} different types of elements to resonate with
Before combat:
	- pick up to {Vision} x 2 elements from the ones they resonate with to imbue onto any skills of their choosing, in any order
	- this creates inscriptions (element patterns) on skills
At the end of each turn:
	- imbue 1 inscription's next element
	- you can only imbue like this {Vision} x 5 times per battle
At each rest:
	- shift up to {Vision} inscribed elements to other elements you resonate with

Inscriptions:
Skills can only hold inscriptions of length 1 unless otherwise specified. A skill can only hold imbued elements up to its inscription length. Once the last element of an inscription has been imbued, the next imbued element will be its first element

Spellcasting:
Using any skill with an inscription opens up a simultaneous action to cast a spell. Casting a spell puts that spell on CD for the user. It also expends the imbued elements that were in the casting requirements. A single long inscription gives characters stacking flexibility, allowing them access to high-level spells and picking from any combination of imbued elements. An array of short inscriptions spread across many skills gives characters immediate flexibility, letting them pick which inscription's next element they want to imbue.
