A jack-of-all-trades who always has an ace up their sleeve, someone both [[Balance|Balanced]] and [[Cunning]]. Where most schemers must approach situations with preparations complete, Rogues formulate and discard plans on the fly.

Rogues gamble their influence against their enemies, making cold reads and stabs in the dark. With their quick thinking and agility, however, the game is stacked in their favor. A good Rogue can draw enemies into an enticing exchange, then constantly run interference and skirt the rules until theyâ€™ve won everything.

UNIQUE:
Sleight of Hand: Swap an enemy's exposed skill in focus with their revealed ACT slot (if they can afford it)
Pickpocket: If your enemy has an exposed skill, you can steal the top skill from their memory. If they have a revealed ACT slot, you can additionally steal an exposed skill
Thieves' Tools: The first time you expose or reveal an enemy skill each turn, you can cycle 1

CUNNING:
Sneak Attack: Target an enemy and declare 3 ACT types. If this doesn't match any of them, attack and deal big damage
Flashbomb (T3: Enemy targets you): Reveal one of their ACT slots next turn
Glimpse: Target an enemy. They choose an ACT slot to reveal next turn
Profile: Expose all skills of one action type in enemy skillset

BALANCE:
Trinket: Weak attack, block, debuff, or spark generator, decided at resolution
Slipstream: Forget a skill from your skillset, dodge 1
Perch: Enter the Perched stance until your next attack. Gain Dodge 1 each turn start, and you can use any action to Cycle 1
