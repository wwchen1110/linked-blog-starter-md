Whereas a cleric's spellcasting requires consistent devotion, a sorcerer has an instinctive connection with the arcane. Because of this, their powers tend to fluctuate wildly, but a sorcerer who can control their spikes will be a foe to be reckoned with.

Sorcerers combine their [[Vision]] and [[Ardor|Ardor]] to manifest powerful bursts of magic at key moments. Because of this, they specialize in formation breakers, rapid casting, and evocation. Sorcerers can quickly jump from casting simple spells like Firebolt, Shocking Touch, and Light to massive ones like Meteor Shower, Incinerate, and Lightning Storm. This volatility is a double-edged sword, however; if their surge has passed, Sorcerers are much simpler to deal with.
