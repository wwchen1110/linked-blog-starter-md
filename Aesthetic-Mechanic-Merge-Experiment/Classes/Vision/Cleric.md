Visionaries trend towards casting spells through free-form imagination, but Clerics gain it through dedication to a single unchanging framework. This system of belief gives Clerics access to uniquely consistent, stable spellcasting, as long as they obey the rules set for them.

Clerics’ [[Vision]] manifests in a [[Discipline|Disciplined]] way, specializing in channeled magic, warding, and powerful buffs. Unlike Paladins, who use spells to enhance their consistent skills, a Cleric’s purpose is their consistent spells. A Cleric's high stamina allows them to prolong their channels, making the most of each imbued element before unleashing it. By layering long-lasting defensive buffs between efficient channels, a Cleric gradually ascends towards unstoppability.
