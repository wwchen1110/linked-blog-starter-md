While wizards believe that magic is harnessed through creativity and study, clerics believe that it is gained through dedication to a creator deity. This framework gives clerics access to consistent, stable spellcasting, as long as they obey the rules set for them.

Clerics’ [[Vision]] manifests in a [[Discipline|Disciplined]] way, specializing in ritual magic, warding, and powerful buffs. Unlike Paladins, whose spells are prepared as they follow their code, Clerics must be constantly channeling magic. A Cleric's high stamina allows them to prolong their rituals, which only require an initial spellcasting investment before relying on stamina to maintain. On top of that, higher-end Clerics can use physically taxing spells that other spellcasters find too risky.
