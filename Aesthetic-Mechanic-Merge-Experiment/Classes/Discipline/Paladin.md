A god rarely executes their own will; more often, their holy warriors will be the ones responsible. Paladins combine esoteric spellcasting with hard steel, capable both of immediate defense and untapped power.

With both high [[Discipline]] and [[Vision]], Paladins utilize their survivability to cast spells unimpeded. As holy warriors, Paladins have a natural affinity for spells that stack power while they honor their oath, allowing them to act more freely than other mages while casting their spells. Paladins of Devotion lean more towards the ecclesiastical, their prayers serving both to honor their oaths and to prepare higher-level rituals, while Paladins of Redemption or Heroism lean more into Discipline with a touch of the divine.

In particular, combining the punishing power of Divine Judgment with the charging capacity of Lay on Hands gives Paladins access to their classic Divine Smite. Lay on Hands itself comes from the restorative powers of Mend and the stacking powers of Ward. Paladins may also find that learning spells like Shield of Faith and Barrier come naturally to them.
