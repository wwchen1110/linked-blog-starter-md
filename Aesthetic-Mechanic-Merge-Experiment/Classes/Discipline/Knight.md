The heroes of every folk tale, and for good reason. In a battle where the lines are clearly drawn, good and evil or black and white, Knights excel at vanquishing their foes.

Knights rise to the occasion for key battles, seizing the critical moment with their [[Ardor|Ardor]] and holding onto it with their [[Discipline]]. Every once in a while, Knights can empower themselves with their Challenge and their Joust. For a single period of action, Knights gain the striking power of a proper Ardent class, as long as they can maintain their stamina. Until their burst returns, Knights are more than capable of holding the line with their Discipline.

UNIQUE:
Challenge: Target an enemy. Both of you gain this effect: until you rest, combatting the opponent of the challenge restores HP/STA
Coat of Arms: An ally gains DEF/STA for the next 5 turns, then ATK/ACT for the 5 turns after
Joust: Choose an attack and an ACT slot. Move towards an enemy until you're in range and make that attack in that ACT slot (paying its costs). Repeat each turn until you have to rest

DISCIPLINE:
Vanquish: Deal damage to enemy based on their recent damage/targeting
Rally: Restore STA and refresh one ability
Shields Up: Your block lasts until you rest. This ability lasts until you rest
Charge: Attack. Deal damage scaling with your STA


Clash: Attack an enemy, and you are now grappling each other until you stop attacking. The enemy can also out-attack or out-block you to break the grapple
Precision: Every time you use the same slot for the same action type >3 turns in a row, enhance the slot with "gain ATK/DEF/RES here, and cards cost less STA here" until you stop
Overcharge: Increase your ATK/DEF for this and the next 3 turns. Each skill you use during this time has its CD doubled
