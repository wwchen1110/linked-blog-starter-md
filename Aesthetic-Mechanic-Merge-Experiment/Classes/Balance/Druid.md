With both [[Balance|Balance]] and [[Vision|Vision]], a Druidâ€™s fluidity in their magic comes from being in harmony with nature. Druidic magic is a way of life rather than an academic study, and their ease of spellcasting demonstrates this difference.

Druids have integrated magic into their beings to such an extent that it is indistinguishable from any other action. This means that they can simplify the prerequisites for spellcasting, allowing them to choose the best spell for the occasion. Druids will have a limited spell list, but of the ones they choose all will be cast at will. Elemental links also allow advanced Druids to pivot from one spell list to another, off of a few key spells.
